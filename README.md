# Make_00_06_Images
The images necessary for lesson 6 of Make Apps with Swift UI

Notes on use: 

For the video, I've added these photos to my project. You have two options for waht to do with them. 
1. In the video, I used the images from the photos app so you can preview the images here in github, long press on the image and save to photos. open phots as your secnd window as I did in the video.I took the additional step of making a album for these, but that is not necessary. 
2. Alternatively you can download the folder, and open the folder in the files app on iPad. 

Either way you will be able to drag and drop the photos into the project.
